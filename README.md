Project developed for the Integration Workshop 2 course in Computer Engineering at UTFPR Curitiba Campus.  

Industrial safety is of paramount importance in factories, especially in places where there is a risk of gas leaks. These leaks, as well as causing losses for companies, can pose health risks to workers, cause explosions, fires and damage the environment.  

With this in mind, this project involves the creation of an autonomous robot capable of moving around inside factories or other closed environments. The robot will use AprilTags scattered around the site to find its way around, following the driving instructions on them. It will also have a camera to analyze images and improve navigation.  

The robot will also have sensors to detect gas leaks and flames, helping to ensure the safety of the environment. As it travels around the site, the robot will send information about the path it has followed and alert an app created by our team in real time about leaks or fires.
